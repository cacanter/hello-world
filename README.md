cacanter first repository

Hello! I'm cacanter, a new programmer who is learning new languages such as SQL, Python, and Ruby. My previous programming experiences involved Matlab and R. This GitHub page will be used for any projects I decide to take on as I become more proficient in programming and continue my learning experience. Thanks!
